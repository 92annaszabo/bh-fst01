    <h1>Aside Example</h1>
    <h2>Ringo Starr Interview</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>How do you continue to find new things to say musically?</strong><br>
        <q>At a certain point, did you ever think you said everything you wanted to say?<br>
        No. If I felt like that, I would have made one record. On this record, we mention<br>
        peace and love at least four times, so I’m promoting peace and love on the record.<br>
        But I’m having a bit of fun with rock and roll and we have a great ballad.<br>
        I also write with other people on this one. If you backtrack to the other records,<br>
        there’s usually ten tracks that I’ve written with someone else, this one has five.<br>
        There’s also a cover of an old song, “Money (That’s What I Want).”<br>
        I wanted to record “Money” and I wanted to do it my way.<br>
        That’s the joy of making your own record: We wanted to do it, so we did.</q><br>

        <strong>Bob Dylan once said all songs were already written and floating around the universe,<br>
        and it’s up to the songwriter to capture them and write them down. Do you agree with that?</strong><br>
        <q>Well, in many ways I really understand what he’s saying. But all we need is one line and then we can<br>
        write a song. Once I put a baseball cap on backwards and went to an event in Los Angeles and the cap<br>
        said “Life is good.” Because of that, they sent me a t-shirt and a book and a lot of stuff.<br>
        So anyway, I’m sitting in my room with (co writer) Gary Burr (trying to write a song) and we don’t<br>
        have anything. Nothing. It’s not coming out of the air. We’re just like... I don’t know.<br>
        But I happen to look at the coffee table and a book was on there that said “Life is good,”<br> 
        and we then we wrote a song from that. We need to just get a kick, and then we can finish any song.</q><br>
