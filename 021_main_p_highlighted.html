                This text is in a p which has the class "highlighted". So it has to be pink.

                <p> This text is in a p which is te child element of another p with the class "highlighted". However the p itself does not have the class "highlighted" . So this text is probably going to remain white.</p>

                <span class="highlighted"> This text is in a span which is in a p. The span has the class "highlighted", but the p does not.
                    So text will have this boring white color. </span>
